## How to Add a File Upload Field to Your Form

To add a file upload field to your HTML form, simply add an `<input type="file">` element. Make sure the `name` attribute of the input matches the column header in your Google Sheet where you want the file link to appear.

```html
<form action="YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
  <input type="file" name="resume" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit Application</button>
</form>
```

**Note:** When using file uploads, you must set the `enctype` of your form to `multipart/form-data`.

## How File Uploads Work

When a user submits a form with a file, Heysheet:
1.  Uploads the file to a secure folder in your Google Drive.
2.  Creates a unique, shareable link for the file.
3.  Adds the file link to the corresponding cell in your Google Sheet.

This process ensures that your files are stored securely and are easily accessible from your spreadsheet.
