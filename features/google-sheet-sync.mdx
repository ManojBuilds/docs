Hey there — if you're like me, you've probably built a landing page or a portfolio and thought:

> _"Okay… now how do I collect form submissions without spinning up an entire backend just for this simple form?"_

You're not alone. Setting up a backend just to capture web form data into a Google Sheet is... well, overkill. That’s exactly why I built **[HeySheet](https://heysheet.in)** — a no-fuss, serverless solution to collect HTML form submissions directly into Google Sheets (or Notion), without writing any backend code.

Let me walk you through how to do it — step-by-step.

---

## Why You Don’t Need a Backend for Forms Anymore

Back in the day, we’d:

- Spin up a Node.js or PHP server,
- Set up routing, validation, and spam protection,
- Deploy and manage hosting just to save 3 fields to a sheet.

Now? You just need an endpoint. That’s it.

And that’s what HeySheet gives you — a plug-and-play form endpoint that connects directly to your Google Sheet.

## ⚡ Let’s Do This in 5 Simple Steps

Ready to see some magic? Let’s get your HTML form wired up to Google Sheets in less than 5 minutes.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create a Google Sheet

Open Google Sheets and make a new spreadsheet.

Add column headers like:

```bash
Name | Email
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create a Form on HeySheet

1. Go to [HeySheet.in](https://heysheet.in)
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click **“Create New Form”**
4. Select the Google Sheet you just created

That’s it — your form is now linked!

---

### ✅ Step 3: Copy the Endpoint

Once your form is created, HeySheet will show you an endpoint like:

```
https://app.heysheet.in/api/s/xyz
```

Copy that — we’ll use it in your HTML.

### ✅ Step 4: Build a Simple HTML Form

Now go to your website code and add this:

```html
<form action="https://app.heysheet.in/api/s/xyz" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="Name" placeholder="Your name" required />
  <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="Your email" required />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

⚠️ **Make sure** the `name` values (`Name`, `Email` ) **match** the column headers in your sheet.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Test It!

Go ahead and submit the form.

You should see the submission pop up in your Google Sheet — instantly.

## Bonus: Add Spam Protection (Optional)

HeySheet already blocks common spam bots, but if you want extra protection:

- Add a **honeypot** field (a hidden input field that bots will fill in, but humans won’t)
- Or use **Google reCAPTCHA** (we’ll add built-in support soon )

---

## Why HeySheet Is So Handy

Here’s why I personally use it on my own side projects:

- ✅ **No backend or database:** Eliminate backend development and directly send form data to Google Sheets without a server or database.
- ✅ **Works perfectly on static sites:** Ideal for static site form submissions (Next.js, Astro, plain HTML, and more).
- ✅ **Native Google Sheets & Notion integration:** Seamlessly connect your forms to the tools you already use.
- ✅ **Secure, fast, and free to get started:** Enjoy secure and lightning-fast form data collection, with a generous free tier to get started.
- ✅ **Looks like magic, but it’s real:** Experience the simplicity of no-code form solutions.

## Bonus Use Cases

You can use HeySheet to collect:

- Contact form messages
- Newsletter signups
- Beta tester interest
- Job applications
- Feedback forms
- Waitlist entries

Basically, anywhere you need form data stored — HeySheet's got your back.

## Wrapping Up

You just connected your HTML form to Google Sheets — without a single line of backend code.

If you're building a landing page, portfolio, or static site and want a fast way to collect form data, definitely give [HeySheet](https://heysheet.in) a spin.
