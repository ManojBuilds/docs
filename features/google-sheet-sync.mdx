## Send Form Data to a Google Sheet

### Why Use Google Sheets as a Form Backend?

Using Google Sheets to store form submissions is a simple and effective solution for many use cases. It eliminates the need for a complex database and provides a familiar interface for managing data.

## How to Connect Your Form to Google Sheets

Follow these five steps to set up your **form submission to Google Sheets** integration:

### 1. Prepare Your Google Sheet

Create a new Google Sheet and define your column headers. These headers will correspond to the `name` attributes in your HTML form fields.

For example:
```
Name | Email | Message
```

### 2. Create a Form in Heysheet

1.  Navigate to the [Heysheet Dashboard](https://heysheet.in).
2.  Click **"Create New Form"**.
3.  Select the Google Sheet you just created.

### 3. Get Your Form Endpoint

Heysheet will generate a unique **form endpoint for Google Sheets**. Copy this URL to use in your HTML form.

### 4. Update Your HTML Form

In your website's code, set the `action` attribute of your form to the Heysheet endpoint URL and the `method` to `POST`.

```html
<form action="YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="Name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
  <textarea name="Message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Important:** The `name` attributes in your form must match the column headers in your Google Sheet exactly.
