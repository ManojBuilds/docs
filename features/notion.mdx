## How to Connect Your Form to a Notion Database

Follow these steps to integrate your form with Notion:

### 1. Set Up Your Notion Database

Create a new database in Notion and define the properties you want to collect from your form. The property names should match the `name` attributes of your form fields.

For example:
| Name | Email          |
| ---- | -------------- |
| Text | Email Property |

### 3. Get Your Form Endpoint

### 4. Configure Your HTML Form

Update your form's `action` attribute to your Heysheet endpoint and set the `method` to `POST`.

```html
<form action="YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="Name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Important:** The `name` attributes in your form must match the property names in your Notion database.
