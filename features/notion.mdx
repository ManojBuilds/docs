Let’s be honest — sometimes all you want is a simple HTML form that sends data to your Notion database.

No backend.
No server code.
Just a clean form → Notion.

That’s exactly why I built **[HeySheet](https://heysheet.in)** — a dead-simple tool to collect HTML form submissions directly into Notion (or Google Sheets), without writing a single line of backend code.

Let me show you how to do it in 5 minutes flat.

## Why You Don't Need a Backend for Notion Forms

Traditionally, pushing form data to Notion meant:

* Creating a backend API with Node.js or Python
* Authenticating with Notion's API
* Handling form submission logic
* Hosting and maintaining all of it

Yeah... no thanks.

With **HeySheet**, you skip all that. Just sign in, link your Notion database, and get a ready-to-use form endpoint. Done.

## ⚡ Let’s Set It Up in 5 Simple Steps

This guide will show you how to submit HTML form data into **Notion** without any backend. Just a form and HeySheet.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create a Notion Database

Head over to [Notion](https://notion.so) and create a new database.

You might set up something like this:

| Name | Email          |
| ---- | -------------- |
| Text | Email Property |

Make sure the property names are exactly what you want to collect from the form.

### ✅ Step 2: Create a Form on HeySheet

1. Go to [HeySheet.in](https://heysheet.in)
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click **“Create New Form”**
4. Choose **Notion** as your destination
5. Connect your Notion account and select the database you just made

That's it — your form is now ready to accept submissions.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Copy Your Form Endpoint

After creating the form, you’ll get a unique endpoint like:

```
https://app.heysheet.in/api/s/xyz
```

This is where your form will send data.

### ✅ Step 4: Build the HTML Form

In your static site or project, use this:

```html
<form action="https://app.heysheet.in/api/s/xyz" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="Name" placeholder="Your name" required />
  <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="Your email" required />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

✅ Make sure the `name` fields (`Name`, `Email`) **match** the property names in your Notion database.

---

---

### ✅ Step 5: Submit and See the Magic

Go ahead and fill the form.

A new row should appear in your Notion database — automatically.

## Bonus: Spam Protection (Optional)

HeySheet already filters out common spam bots. But you can go further:

* Add a **honeypot field** (invisible to humans, but bots might fill it)
* Use **Google reCAPTCHA** (support coming soon)
