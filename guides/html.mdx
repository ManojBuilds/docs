## HTML Form to Google Sheets

Connecting your HTML form to Google Sheets is a common requirement for capturing leads, feedback, or any other user-submitted data from your website. With Heysheet, you can achieve this in just a few minutes without writing any backend code. This guide will walk you through the process of sending form data from a standard HTML form to a Google Sheet.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A Heysheet account (you can sign up for free).
- A Google account to create a Google Sheet.
- A basic HTML form on your website.

### Step 1: Create a Form in Heysheet

1.  Log in to your Heysheet account and go to the dashboard.
2.  Click on the "Create Form" button.
3.  Give your form a name (e.g., "Contact Form").
4.  Select "Google Sheets" as the destination.
5.  Connect your Google account and select the Google Sheet you want to use.
6.  Heysheet will generate a unique form endpoint URL for you. Copy this URL.

### Step 2: Update Your HTML Form

Now, you need to update your HTML form to send submissions to the Heysheet endpoint.

```html
<form action="YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Replace `YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT` with the URL you copied from your Heysheet dashboard.

### Step 3: Test Your Form

That's it! Your form is now connected to Google Sheets. Open the page with your form and submit a test entry. You should see the data appear in your Google Sheet instantly.
