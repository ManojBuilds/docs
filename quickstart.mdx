## Get started with Heysheet

Heysheet lets developers send form submissions directly to Google Sheets using a simple API â€” no backend needed.

This quickstart will walk you through:

1. Connecting your Google Sheet  
2. Sending a form submission  
3. Previewing data in your Sheet

---

## 1. Connect your Google Sheet

To begin:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="google-sheets" title="Authorize Google Sheets">
    Head over to your [Heysheet Dashboard](https://heysheet.in/dashboard) and connect your Google account.  
    Select the spreadsheet you want to use to collect responses.
    
    > âœ… Heysheet will ask for minimal permissions and only needs access to the sheet(s) you select.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="table" title="Map your sheet columns">
    Once connected, Heysheet will let you map form fields to your sheet's column headers.  
    This determines where each submitted value will be stored.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## 2. Send your first submission

You can now start sending data to your sheet using the generated API endpoint.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Send a POST request">
    Here's a sample `fetch` request to submit form data:

    ```ts
    await fetch("https://api.heysheet.in/forms/your-form-id", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "john@example.com",
        message: "Hey, this is my submission!"
      }),
    });
    ```

    You can also use `curl` or any HTTP client (like Axios, SuperAgent, etc).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Secure your endpoint">
    - Each endpoint is rate-limited and protected from abuse.
    - For added security, you can enable CAPTCHA and domain whitelisting in the dashboard.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. View responses in your Sheet

Once the form is submitted, data will appear instantly in your connected Google Sheet.

> ðŸ“Œ No need to refresh â€” it updates in real-time.
