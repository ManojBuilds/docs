## Send Your First Form Submission to Google Sheets

Heysheet provides a **form endpoint for Google Sheets**, allowing you to send form data directly to a spreadsheet with no backend code. This guide will show you how to set up your **HTML form to Google Sheets** integration in just a few minutes.

This quickstart covers:
1.  Connecting Heysheet to your Google Sheet.
2.  Updating your HTML form to send data.
3.  Viewing your form submissions in real-time.

## 1. Connect Your Google Sheet

First, you need to connect your Heysheet account to a Google Sheet.

1.  Go to the [Heysheet Dashboard](https://app.heysheet.in).
2.  Sign in and authorize your Google account.
3.  Choose the Google Sheet you want to use as your **form backend**.
4.  Map your form fields (e.g., `name`, `email`) to the columns in your sheet.

> ✅ Your data is secure. Heysheet doesn't store your submissions and only accesses the sheets you select.

## 2. Send a Test Submission

After connecting your sheet, Heysheet will give you a unique **form submission API endpoint**. You'll use this URL in your HTML form's `action` attribute.

### Example: HTML Form to Google Sheets

```html
<form action="YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Replace `YOUR_HEYSHEET_ENDPOINT` with the URL from your Heysheet dashboard.

## 3. See Your Data in Google Sheets

Submit your form, and the data will instantly appear in your connected Google Sheet. There's no need to refresh the page; the data syncs in real-time. This makes it a perfect **no-code form to spreadsheet** solution.
