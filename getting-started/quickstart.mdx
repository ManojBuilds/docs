## Get started with Heysheet

Heysheet lets developers send form submissions directly to Google Sheets using a simple API — no backend required.

This quickstart will walk you through:

1. Connecting your Google Sheet  
2. Sending a form submission  
3. Viewing data in your Sheet

---

## 1. Connect your Google Sheet

1. Visit the [Heysheet Dashboard](https://app.heysheet.in)  
2. Sign in with your Google account and authorize access  
3. Choose a spreadsheet you want to connect  
4. Map your sheet's column headers to field keys like `name`, `email`, `message`

> ✅ Heysheet only requests permission for the specific sheets you select. Your data is never stored on our servers.

---

## 2. Send your first submission

Once you’ve connected your sheet, you’ll get a secure API endpoint to send data.

### Example using `html form`:

```html
<form action="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SUBMISSION_ENDPOINT" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

```

You can also use `curl`, `axios`, or any HTTP client.

{/* > 🛡️ Your endpoint is protected from spam by default. Enable optional domain whitelisting, rate limits, or CAPTCHA in your dashboard. */}

---

## 3. View your responses

As soon as a user submits the form, their data will appear in your linked Google Sheet — no syncing or refresh required.

> 📌 Each field is matched with the correct column automatically.
